# GitLaw

Welcome to the repository for my exploration of government and the law as operating system and code, the implications, and what the government can learn from the people working with complex computer code.

I'm Adam. I set this up. I'm working on it. If you're reading this drop me a line, let me know how you got here.

I don't know what form this project will take. I'm a tech nerd turned law student. I'm not a programmer, but as a project manager and UX guy I've worked alongside programmers for years. That's how I find myself writing a final paper in markdown, and collaborating through Github/Gitbook. Mostly as a test of the tools for use in this type of work.

I want to apply what I know from computers and program to what I'm learning about law, first move is to put my thoughts on paper. That's what you see above.

That's what you've got here so far. Interested, dig in, reach out.
