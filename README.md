###Hello!

Welcome to the repository for my exploration of government and the law as operating system and code, the implications, and what the government can learn from the people working with complex computer code.

I'm Adam. I set this up. I'm working on it, right now, if you're here you're a friend, classmate, family member or professor. Thank you for taking a look!

Mostly this presentation, versus, say, just sending you a document to scribble on is a test in using the same tools that programmers use to coordinate and collaborate while working on really complicated computer programs.

I want to apply what I know from computers and programming to what I'm learning about law, first move is to put my thoughts down. That's what you'll see here.

I'm working continually, so what you see here is what I've got so far. Interested, dig in, reach out. You should be able to comment with thoughts or questions by clicking the little plus that comes up when you mouse over any given section.

If you've got a few minutes the video below is the thing that got me going down this road to begin with. I retread some of Shirky's stuff here, but I'm trying to end with at least the start for an actual proposal, and a discussion of its merits. I'll keep putting other cool links down here as I bump into them.
